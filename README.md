# crime-map-challenge



Full specs, can be found [here](FrontEndCrimeMapTest.pdf).

How to run:

```commandline
> git clone git@github.com:humancatfood/crime-map-challenge.git

> cd crime-map-challenge

> (npm|yarn) install

> (npm|yarn) start

```

Then open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` (in dev-mode, the maps-api is restricted to `l`ocalhost`, so `127.0.0.1` etc won't work)

OR

go [here](git@github.com:humancatfood/crime-map-challenge.git)

---

The code is pretty straightforward and self-documenting, except for the [crime service](src/js/crime-service.js) and the [Google Maps helper](src/js/google-maps-helper.js) which do have some documentation.
